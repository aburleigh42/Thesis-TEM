# Thesis-TEM
Representative sample of acquired TEM micrographs for SAED and HREM analysis

The files are grouped first by irradiation: MIBL at 100 deg C (MIBL-100), and IRRSUD at 300 deg C (IRRSUD-300)

MIBL-100: POCO ZXF-5Q
2 lift outs from each irradiated area (pristine, 0.1 DPA, 0.6 DPA, and 0.9 DPA). 
In each directory is a survey and the SAED and HREM micrographs from each region examined. 
One representative image of a FIB lift-out from pristine POCO ZXF-5Q is included. 

IRRSUD-300: POCO ZXF-5Q (POCO) and IG-430 (IG)
Pristine, 0.07 DPA and 0.27 DPA with (-He) and w/o helium pre-implantation. 
In each directory is a survey and an image of the FIB lift-out along with the SAED and HREM micrographs from each region examined.
